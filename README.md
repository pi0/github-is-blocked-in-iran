## Preface
The domain `raw.githubusercontent.com` is blocked in Iran using DNS pollution for  a *never said reason*.
Till yesterday, It was pointing to an intranet ip `10.10.34.34` which shows "this web site is blocked".
As a workaround, `/etc/hosts` could be used in order to bypass this.
Since yesterday (24 April 2017) this censorship has been hardened and "Deep Packet Inspection" is in place to entirly block access to this domain!

## What is purpose of this motivation
This repo is not intented for doing illegal things and bypassing limits. We are looking for a way reuinion iranian developers using legal ways to remove this censorship.

## What can i do ?
- Spread the world and invite your iranian friends to this motivation.
- If you know any way reporting and asking goverment the reason of this censorship please let us know.
- If you can contact Github team to get help from them.
